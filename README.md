# Melanoma-Detection
This project was completed in collaboration with a study partner as part of a data science workshop.
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - **Mount Google Drive:** Set up paths for training, validation, and test datasets.
   - **Load Libraries:** You’re using libraries like `cv2`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`, and `fastai` for different tasks.
   - **Data Loading:** Created functions to load data into DataFrames, visualized data distribution, and performed data augmentation to balance the dataset.
   - **Data Visualization:** Analyzed image characteristics (color channels, noise, etc.) and applied various image processing techniques (Gaussian blur, contrast adjustment).

2. **Data Augmentation:**
   - **Upsampling:** Added rotated images to balance classes, improving the model's ability to generalize.
   - **Image Processing:** Applied techniques like noise reduction, Gaussian blur, and thresholding to enhance image features.

3. **Model Training:**
   - **CNN Implementation:** Used FastAI’s `DataBlock` API to create a data pipeline and trained a ResNet18 model.
   - **Evaluation:** Achieved an error rate of 0.17 after training for 4 epochs, indicating a precision of 83%.

### Considerations and Next Steps

1. **Data Augmentation:**
   - **Enhance Diversity:** Consider adding more augmentation techniques such as scaling, cropping, or color jittering to improve robustness.
   - **Advanced Libraries:** Explore libraries like `imgaug` or `albumentations` for more sophisticated augmentation techniques.

2. **Model Evaluation:**
   - **Additional Metrics:** Besides error rate, look at metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC for a comprehensive evaluation.
   - **Confusion Matrix:** Plot confusion matrices to understand where the model is making errors.

3. **Model Improvement:**
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and different optimizers.
   - **Alternative Architectures:** Try other architectures such as ResNet34, DenseNet, or EfficientNet for potentially better performance.

4. **Validation and Testing:**
   - **Cross-Validation:** Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure consistent performance across different subsets of data.
   - **External Validation:** Test your model on external datasets to verify its generalizability.

5. **Deployment:**
   - **Model Saving:** Save your trained model and consider exporting it for deployment in a web or mobile application.
   - **User Interface:** Develop a simple interface for users to upload images and receive melanoma predictions.

6. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Document your findings, methodologies, and results clearly. Prepare a report or presentation summarizing your approach, results, and potential impact.
